\description{
The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) is a measure of the
effectiveness of a compound in inhibiting biological or biochemical
function.  This quantitative measure indicates how much of a particular drug
or other substance (inhibitor) is needed to inhibit a given biological
process (or component of a process) by half.

See reference(s).

In this version of the function the maximal occupancy (rmax) is estimated
automatically.  This should be optional.
