\title{
  The Simplified Reference Tissue Model
}
\description{
  The simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) estimates the binding
  potential from an observed time activity curve without the need for
  aterial sampling.  It assumes a one-tissue compartment model to
  describe the influx and efflux in the tissue region of interest and
  the reference region.
}
\usage{
simplifiedReferenceTissueModel(tac, ref, time, SRTM2 = TRUE, k2prime = NULL,
                               guess = c(R1 = 0.5, k2 = 0.01),
                               control = nls.lm.control())
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{tac}{a vector corresponding to the time activity curve from the
    tissue (in Bq/mL).}
  \item{ref}{a vector corresponding to the time activity curve from the
    reference region (in Bq/mL).}
  \item{time}{a vector of average frame times (in minutes).}
  \item{SRTM2}{a logical value that selects the three-parameter model
    (SRTM) or the two-parameter model (SRTM2), where k2prime is fixed.}
  \item{k2prime}{the value of k2prime that has been fixed.}
  \item{guess}{values for the inital parameter estimates for R1 and k2.}
  \item{control}{a list of parameters used by \code{nls.lm.control}
    that are set by default, but may be customized by the user.}
}
\details{
  See the references.

  The model has been parameterized in the manner of Wu and Carson
  (2002).  That is, the nonlinear regression estimates R1, k2 and k'2
  for the three-parameter model (SRTM) and R1 and k2 for the
  two-parameter model (SRTM2).

  The convolution is performed after interpolating the time activity
  curves, both for the tissue and the reference region, to one-second
  resolution then downsampling them back to the original sampling rate.
