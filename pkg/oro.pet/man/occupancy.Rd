\title{
  Compute Drug Occupancy with Approximate Standard Errors
}
\description{
  Receptor occupancy is calculated from posititron emission tomography
  (PET) data as the treatment-induced relative change in the
  concentration of available (not occupied) receptors.
}
\usage{
occupancy(base, drug, baseSE = NULL, drugSE = NULL, base.drug.corr = 0)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{base}{is the baseline binding potential (BPND).}
  \item{drug}{is the post-treatment binding potential (BPND).}
  \item{baseSE}{is the standard error for the baseline BPND.}
  \item{drugSE}{is the standard error for the post-treatment BPND.}
  \item{base.drug.corr}{is the correlation between baseline and
    post-treatment binding potentials.}
}
\details{
  Occupancy is calculated using the straightforward and well-known
  formula.  The delta method is used to approximate the standard error
  for the estimate of occupancy.
}
\value{
  \item{OCC}{is the percent drug occupancy.}
  \item{SE}{is the approximate standard error of the parameter estimate.}
