\title{
The Multilinear Reference Tissue Model
}
\description{
  The multilinear reference tissue model (MRTM) estimates the binding
  potential from an observed time activity curve without the need for
  arterial sampling.  Instead, a second time activity curve must be
  provided from a suitable reference region where there is negligible
  binding.
}
\usage{
multilinearReferenceTissueModel(tac, ref, time, tstar, MRTM2 = TRUE, k2prime = NULL)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{tac}{a vector corresponding to the time activity curve from the
    tissue (in Bq/mL).}  
  \item{ref}{a vector corresponding to the time activity curve from the
    reference region (in Bq/mL).}
  \item{time}{a vector of average frame times (in minutes).}
  \item{tstar}{the time (in minutes) where the linear relationship
    between the response and covariates may be assumed to be true.}
  \item{MRTM2}{a logical value that selects the three-parameter model
    (MRTM) or the two-parameter model (MRTM2), where k2prime is fixed.}
  \item{k2prime}{the value of k2prime that has been fixed.}
}
\details{
  See the references.

  The numeric integration required to construct the design matrix is
  performed by interpolating the time activity curves, both for the
  tissue and reference region, to one-second resolution and then
  performing the \code{cumsum} operation on them.

  Given the nonlinear relationship between binding potential and the
  regression parameters, the \code{deltamethod} is used to approximate
  its standard error.

\value{
  \item{BP}{Binding potential}
  \item{BP.error}{Approximate standard error of the binding potential}
  \item{R1}{Ratio of the volumes of distrubution for the tissue and
    reference region (assumes a one-tissue model is valid)}
  \item{R1.error}{Approximate standard error for the ratio}
  \item{k2}{Clearance rate constant from the tissue to plasma (assumes a
  one-tissue model is valid)}
  \item{k2.error}{Approximate standard error for k2}
  \item{X}{Design matrix used in the linear regression}
  \item{beta}{Regression coefficients}
